### Method 2: Export as Application

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note about Permissions:**

**The exported app will likely encounter this error:**
```
System Events got an error: "" is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)assistive access).
```

This is a common macOS security limitation for unsigned applications that try to control other applications.

To resolve this:
- You'll need to code sign the app using your Apple Developer certificate
- If you don't have a Developer certificate, it's recommended to use Method 1 or Option B below

#### Option B: Using Script Debugger (Alternative)
1. [Script Debugger](https://latenightsw.com/) (third-party app)
2. Copy and paste the script code
3. Save as application
4. Run directly without code signing issues
